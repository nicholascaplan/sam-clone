# Samantha Fernando Website Content Record

## Biography Page

**Source of truth: Sanity.** The Biography is managed in the `biographyPage` singleton in Sanity project `9a66iw1t` (dataset `production`) and rendered into `index.html` at build time. The copy below is the seeded content and the committed fallback; after the first edit in Sanity, the Studio is canonical and this section should be kept in step with it.

Biography is an in-page `#bio` route in `index.html`, opened by the `Biography` navigation item. On mobile, a compact circular portrait breaks up the opening copy; larger screens retain the supporting portrait alongside the profile, milestones, education and fellowship.

### Artistic Philosophy & Biography

In recent years, her music has moved towards a language that values clarity, directness, and openness: working with deliberately limited material, allowing music time to breathe, and attending with precision to gesture, texture, and form.

Collaboration with performers is central to her practice, particularly in shaping sound worlds that respond to the physicality of instruments and the acoustic space in which music is heard.

Samantha has worked with numerous world-leading ensembles including the Philharmonia Orchestra, London Sinfonietta, BCMG, Riot Ensemble, The BBC Singers, LOD Muziektheater (Ghent), Silbersee Vocal Ensemble (Amsterdam), and The Crossing (USA). Her music has been performed at major international festivals including Aldeburgh Music, Huddersfield Contemporary Music Festival, Sounds New, Gaudeamus Muziekweek, York Late Music, and the Oxford Lieder Festival.

Samantha studied Composition at the Royal Academy of Music and the University of Oxford. She holds a PhD in Composition. She is an Honorary Research Fellow in Composition at Royal Holloway, University of London.

In 2021, Samantha saw the opening of Current, Rising, a world-first hyper-reality opera experience produced by the Royal Opera House and Figment Productions. Her chamber opera glass human, created in collaboration with Melanie Wilson, premiered at Glyndebourne in Autumn 2022. Recent commissions include Sound Inhabitants for the London Sinfonietta and Wintering, commissioned by Wigmore Hall and performed by Manchester Collective and The Marian Consort.

### Works Card Standard

Each Works card uses the same fields: year, controlled category, duration, title, instrumentation, commission, premiere and optional notes. The category is the only pill shown on the card; venues, ensembles, awards and recording labels belong in the relevant metadata field instead. Works with hosted audio or video have consistent fine-outline media actions, stacked vertically when there is more than one. Each uses a play icon and a specific label such as `Listen`, `Trailer`, `Performance excerpt`, `Insights` or `Watch`; works without hosted media have no row action.

Media actions use explicit related-Work references, including the three tracks from 3 Songs for Soprano and Cello. Editors can set their order within a Work; Listen and Watch remain newest-first catalogue views. Composition structured data is generated from the same published Work records during the content build.

- The soundbar presents elapsed time and a display-only progress line for all embedded recordings. It does not support seeking.
- SoundCloud progress is retrieved from the Widget API and includes the recording duration.
- Spotify progress is a local elapsed-time estimate for the fixed 30-second preview. The Spotify IFrame API does not expose playback position or seeking.
- The header Listen control and soundbar pause control pause or resume the active recording.
- The soundbar has separate restart and stop controls. Stop clears all playback state and hides the soundbar immediately; opening a video does the same before playback begins.

## Writing

- Page description: Personal essays on creative process, composition, and artistic philosophy.
- Article type: Featured Essay
- Title: On My Creative Process: 1. Wintering
- Date: November 2025
- Image: `assets/sam-3.webp`, portrait of Samantha Fernando.
- Photo credit: Mike Skelton
- Opening paragraph: Why do I write? What makes me start? Sometimes it’s a book, sometimes a painting, a poem, or a place. Reflecting on my practice, I see there is always the impulse to respond to something or somewhere. It is an emotive impulse before it is a musical utterance.
- Paragraph: For this first foray into writing about my process, it makes sense to consider the book Wintering by Katherine May, since the piece it inspired will be premiered in a matter of days by the Manchester Collective and the Marian Consort at the Wigmore Hall.
- Paragraph: Like many, I have always found winter difficult—something to endure. Its approach fills me with foreboding. The lack of sunlight, the cold seeping into my bones, and the threat of illness all contribute to the struggle. I used to try to keep busy in the hope that the weeks would pass more quickly.
- Paragraph: Reading May’s book was something of a revelation; it offered a way of accepting, even embracing, winter. It suggested that constant busyness might not be the answer—that there might be value in stepping back.
- Paragraph: The notion of “wintering” applies not only to the season but to any period in life when rest, repair, and nourishment are needed: grief, illness, or times of transition. May uses examples from nature, how animals hibernate as well as telling her own story of how she wintered through a difficult period of her life. She also references winter rituals and the power they have to provide solidarity and comfort.
- Paragraph: The book is very evocative; the descriptive writing conjures up both external wintery landscapes as well as the complex internal landscapes we create in our minds. It is this sense of landscape that resonated with me on a musical level. I could hear these landscapes.
- Paragraph: It has taken some time to get to this point, but I am finally finding a sense of my creative voice. What it is that I want to explore through sound. I’ve found this through reflecting on my recent work and the patterns that have begun to emerge. Landscape, a sense of place, architecture, these things all feed into my impulse to compose. I am trying to create a place in sound. One that I can invite an audience into.
- Paragraph: This necessitates a musical language that is not overly-complicated but has a certain directness. I try to create space and time to breathe within the music I write. In pursuit of this, I have found the need to strip things back, take things out, linger for longer. My music isn’t minimalist with a capital M but minimal in material, yes. Stripping back has meant that the material I do use is very deliberate and carries more weight. Detail matters enormously and gestures are intentional.
- Paragraph: I’ve realised that uncovering my musical voice requires attentiveness to what I want to hear—not what I think others want to hear. It means letting go of the fear of judgement.
- Paragraph: Most recently I have found inspiration in composers like Jurg Frey, John Luther Adams and Hildegard Von Bingen. Looking far back and not so far back. Wintering is a piece that culminates some of these influences, impulses and my sense of purpose. It isn’t supposed to be a piece that acts as some sort of musical balm but an evocation of both external Winter landscape and the internal psychological landscape that necessitates the need to winter.
- Closing paragraph: I’m still uncovering, still trying to get closer to the compositional ideals I hold in mind. Creation isn’t linear. But in articulating these thoughts now, I’m putting a pin on the map—in the hope that this moment of clarity propels me forward and, more hopefully still, offers you some insight into my music.
